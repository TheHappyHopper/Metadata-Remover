# Metadata-Remover
# PYTHON 3 IS NEEDED TO RUN THIS PROGRAM
# This program is designed to Batch delete all metadata from any images placed in the target directory, simply place images in the target directory and run either run.sh(bash) or run.bat(windows command prompt)
# This will clear the metadata from the image, compatible file types are .jpg/jpeg .png and .tiff
# The program will also check for and attempt to install exiftool automatically, which is required for the program to run.
# If the target directory does not exist the program will create one for you.
