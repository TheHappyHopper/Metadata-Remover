# Metadata-Remover
PYTHON 3 IS NEEDED TO RUN THIS PROGRAM
This program is designed to Batch delete all metadata from any images placed in the target folder, simply place images in the target directory and run either run.sh(bash) or run.bat(windows command prompt)
This will clear the metadata from the image
The program will also check for and attempt to install exiftool automatically, which is required for the program to run.
